# face-detection
Create virtual env and install requirements.txt using command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Check out the "faces" directory for large dataset of my faces that were taken while I was at work.
Open Jupyterhub preferably with Anaconda, and run notebook. Python video window should appear like so. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11686738/62110306-fe083280-b262-11e9-9d8b-66b37a70edd7.png)
Run facial_recognition notebook to store faces from webcam into faces directory
Run learn_joshua_face notebook to classify faces from webcam based on data in faces directory
Delete my face's data in faces directory, and keep yours
Please message me on linkedin for any questions : https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-kang-ucsd/


Future projects: attach this to a raspberry pi with camera on my self driving drone to classify people.
